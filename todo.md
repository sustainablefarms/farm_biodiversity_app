# Inputs
+ DONE: Rainfall since August: might be challenging for people to calculate that accurately, maybe a generic “12 month total rainfall” (struggling for exact wording), so then they can either calculate for calendar year or since August as they prefer. I also wondered is the default 708mm rainfall the average for the entire region? When you click on a region it says the long term average for that region below (great feature), would it be possible to make it so when you click on a region that is the auto set amount?
  + I don't know what the 12 month total rainfall would mean for the model
+ woody canopy in raw areas, not percentages

# Help
+ splash page 
  + birds on farms imagery
+ use icons or virtual tours

## More Help
+ species list? describe species
  + species removed
+ types of farms in More Information
+ links to box gum grassy woodlands

## Caveats
+ get max patch size for model (Ask Dan for patch areas, to look for maximum in our data)
+ __box gum grassy woodlands__ and plantings
  + __test on other woodlands__

# Outputs
+ convert plotly to have the default cursor style
+ show the ref values in a tooltip or something


# Outputs: More Detail

# Overall
+ Mobile compatibility
  + test on tablet, touch screen only
+ need ecology team to read through it
+ then get comms team to look at it again
+ Get DBL to look through it
+ Authorship: Martin, Albert, Dan?

# Other
+ __Get onto SF website__
+ check: my model says Superb Parrots are more likely with Noisy Miners!?

## Love to do
+ trait indications
+ show birds of particular body size
+ Easy way to get amount with 500m or 3000m of a latitude and longitude
  + a drop pin style interface would be great, but putting in lat lon would also be ok
  + they need to put year in
+ context on managing Noisy Miners, and other farm-scale decisions?
+ convert to a mobile app - perahps using "shinyMobile" - but it might work well on a mobile naturally

+ multiple named references

+ Example pictures of woody canopy

+ improved title?
  + Bird Occupancy Model
  + Bird Occupancy Estimator
