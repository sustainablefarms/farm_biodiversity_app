# Inputs
+ woody veg
  + 'with' -> 'within'
+ turn off ticks between each patch number
+ remove region 'young' - keep only 'young region'
+ change noisy miner image and words

# Help
## More Help
+ grammar fix
+ species list? describe species
  + species removed
+ add references to Tobler, WVC, Noisy Miners and Shiny
+ correct prec seasonality YfA
+ types of farms in More Information

## Caveats
+ __get max patch size for model__ (Ask Dan for patch areas, to look for maximum in our data)
+ patch definition: make clear that it is for our model, not a general definition of patch
+ __box gum grassy woodlands and plantings__
  + __test on other woodlands__

# Outputs
+ delete species
  + delete species not in the 7_4 model
  + delete Australasian Pipit: DBL says "it is a pasture bird, so very common on farms but not often observed in woodland patches"
  + delete the Australian Wood Duck

+ __brief bird info for tool tips__
+ disable clicking on the plotly figures (try highlight() options)
+ make ratio a log scale
+ less woodland --> less *canopy* nearby
+ tool tip update
+ make the ratio plot and title appear separately on small screens

# Outputs: More Detail
+ include species of conservation concern - check on new plantings model
+ ALA photos
+ bird names above photos
+ update descriptions now that best site isn't used per-se
+ report figures and words need polishing

# Overall
+ Martin second author
+ Mobile compatibility
  + test on tablet, touch screen only

# Other
+ __Get onto SF website__

## Love to do
+ trait indications
+ show birds of particular body size
+ Easy way to get amount with 500m or 3000m of a latitude and longitude
+ context on managing Noisy Miners, and other farm-scale decisions?
+ convert to a mobile app - perahps using "shinyMobile" - but it might work well on a mobile naturally

+ __get permission from BirdLife:__ try James Oconnor
   + e.g. use of birdlife:
     + in more details report
     + in more details modal
     + in Noisy Miner check box

+ Example pictures of woody canopy

+ __photos of the birds will be really important. Maybe in the more details section. Tell a little story about the birds.__
   + use ALA, BirdLife or eBird
   + try Patrick Kavanagh and Craig Greer (might cost money)
   + send list to Tabitha

+ improved title?
  + 'Expected Spring Birds in Your Woodland'
  + 'Which Birds in Your Woodland'
  + 'Expected Birds: Woodland birds you can expect to see on your farm in spring'
  + 'Bird Anticipator: Woodland birds you can expect to see on your farm in spring'
  + 'Bird Checker'
