# Inputs
+ use photos for midstorey (all veg surveys had 1 - 2 photos)

+ Investigate and comment on difference between quadrat method and point-intersect method
+ patch definition: make clear that it is for our model, not a general definition of patch
+ __spring birds__, not winter birds

# Outputs
+ add description of error bars as popup
+ for relative probability: show what the baseline is. Relative to what!?
+ print out results (csv for quick version)

# Overall
+ Colors:
  + change color schemes to make titles easier to read?
  + use SF colors
