# Unsorted
+ Weebill should be smallest by weight and length --> error it isn't in the plot
+ include relatively less likely to occur species in the more details section
+ include species of conservation concern
+ bare soil as an input will be hard
+ get the IsPlanting tick in there!
+ photos of the birds will be really important. Maybe in the more details section. Tell a little story about the birds.

# Inputs
+ use photos for midstorey (all veg surveys had 1 - 2 photos)
+ Include link to woody veg data in the woody veg tool tip

# Caveats
+ Ask Dan for patch areas, to look for maximum in our data
+ Investigate and comment on difference between quadrat method and point-intersect method
+ patch definition: make clear that it is for our model, not a general definition of patch
+ __spring birds__, not winter birds

# Outputs
+ add description of error bars as popup
+ for relative probability: show what the baseline is. Relative to what!?
+ print out results (csv for quick version)
+ title for prediction plots

# Overall
+ Colors:
  + change color schemes to make titles easier to read?
  + use SF colors
+ make tooltips appear reliably (as of march 10, 2021, shinyBS::tipify did not reliably appear, and tippy::with_tippy did not work inside modals).
  + this page seems to be on the same topic https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12758872/how-do-i-use-tooltip-plugin-in-twitter-bootstraps-modal-dialog and suggests upgrade to bootstrap 3
+ convert to a mobile app - perahps using "shinyMobile" - but it might work well on a mobile naturally

# Other
+ Get the SF logo back on the page
+ Include contact details for bugs etc

## Love to do
- trait indications
- show birds of particular body size
