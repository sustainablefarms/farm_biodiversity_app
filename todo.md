# Unsorted

# Inputs
+ use photos for midstorey (all veg surveys had 1 - 2 photos)
+ woody veg
  + tree canopy within 500m of the 'centre' of a patch?
  + Include link to woody veg data in the woody veg tool tip
+ Tumut climate information is extreme: improve it
+ bare soil as an input will be hard

# Caveats
+ Ask Dan for patch areas, to look for maximum in our data
+ Investigate and comment on difference between quadrat method and point-intersect method
+ patch definition: make clear that it is for our model, not a general definition of patch
+ __spring birds__, not winter birds

# Outputs
+ add description of error bars as popup
+ for relative probability: show what the baseline is. Relative to what!?
+ print out results (csv for quick version)
+ title for prediction plots

# Outputs: More Detail
+ Weebill should be smallest by weight and length --> error it isn't in the plot
+ include relatively less likely to occur species in the more details section
+ include species of conservation concern
+ photos of the birds will be really important. Maybe in the more details section. Tell a little story about the birds.
   + use ALA, BirdLife or eBird

# Overall
+ get the IsPlanting tick in there!
+ Colors:
  + change color schemes to make titles easier to read?
+ Mobile compatibility
  + test on tablet, touch screen only
  + convert to a mobile app - perahps using "shinyMobile" - but it might work well on a mobile naturally

# Other
+ Get the SF logo back on the page
+ Include contact details for bugs etc
