# Inputs
+ __woody veg__
  + tree canopy within 500m of the 'centre' of a patch?
  + Example photos
  + Include link to woody veg data in the woody veg tool tip
  + Easy way to get amount with 500m or 3000m of a latitude and longitude
+ __Tumut climate information is extreme: improve it__

# Caveats
+ __get max patch size for model__ (Ask Dan for patch areas, to look for maximum in our data)
+ Investigate and comment on difference between quadrat method and point-intersect method
+ patch definition: make clear that it is for our model, not a general definition of patch
+ __spring birds__, not winter birds
+ __sedentary birds?__
+ most likely species __in the woodland patches__ of your farm
+ box gum grassy woodlands and plantings
  + test on other woodlands
+ types of farms

# Outputs
+ add description of error bars as popup
+ for relative probability: show what the baseline is. Relative to what!?
+ print out results (csv for quick version)
  + get the screen that says generating xyz working
+ delete Australasian Pipit: DBL says "it is a pasture bird, so very common on farms but not often observed in woodland patches"
+ __get permission from BirdLife:__ try James Oconnor
   + e.g. use of birdlife:
     + in more details report
     + in more details modal
     + in Noisy Miner check box
+ brief bird info for tool tips

# Outputs: More Detail
+ include relatively less likely to occur species in the more details section
+ include species of conservation concern - check for new plantings model
+ __photos of the birds will be really important. Maybe in the more details section. Tell a little story about the birds.__
   + use ALA, BirdLife or eBird
   + try Patrick Kavanagh and Craig Greer (might cost money)
   + send list to Tabitha

# Overall
+ __Overall instructions for first users opening the app__
+ __get the IsPlanting tick in there!__
+ __lots more help for users__
  + where model came from
  + year prediction?
  + types of birds
+ __title__
  + 'Expected Spring Birds in Your Woodland'
  + 'Which Birds in Your Woodland'
  + 'Expected Birds: Woodland birds you can expect to see on your farm in spring'
  + 'Bird Anticipator: Woodland birds you can expect to see on your farm in spring'
+ Mobile compatibility
  + test on tablet, touch screen only
  + convert to a mobile app - perahps using "shinyMobile" - but it might work well on a mobile naturally

# Other
+ Martin on credits
+ Get the SF logo back on the page
