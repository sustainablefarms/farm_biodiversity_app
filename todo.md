+ mistakes in the app
  + terms need more work
  + why would someone want to use this app. Say it up front! Scenario planning estimates.
  + graphs are too hard to understand
  + More Help: species tooltips
  + click on the different patches
  + use icons or virtual tours
  + occupancy probability relative to reference
    + colors to reference. Same help as the other plot
    + ratio value is show in the box. For example a 'x 2.56' means the species 2.5 times more likely to occur in the current set of patches than the reference.
+ need ecology team to read through it
  + Colleen to send detailed points through
  + More Help section to "Comparison to References"
+ where bird size from bird table
+ report: include chosen region
+ long-term climate averages aren't just for spring - say average annual maximum temperature 
+ then get comms team to look at it again
+ make 'i' buttons larger and maybe a different color
+ small birds showing up?
+ state-based threatened species
+ Bird Predictor (ask Suzannah or David)
+ Colleen some issues sent by Thursday
+ Get DBL to look through it


+ LLS sharable
  + use link 

+ Does the app need to change for the results workshops?
+ used offline?!

# Inputs
+ check that noisy miners like woodland that has few low trees or shrubs.

# Help
## More Help
+ grammar fix
+ species list? describe species
  + species removed
+ add references to Tobler, WVC, Noisy Miners and Shiny
+ correct prec seasonality YfA
+ types of farms in More Information
+ include patch definition
+ links to box gum grassy woodlands

## Caveats
+ get max patch size for model (Ask Dan for patch areas, to look for maximum in our data)
+ __box gum grassy woodlands__ and plantings
  + __test on other woodlands__

# Outputs
+ convert plotly to have the default cursor style

# Outputs: More Detail
+ ALA photos
+ include app url 'appurl'
+ birdlife images take a REALLY long time (30s) to be generated

# Overall
+ Mobile compatibility
  + test on tablet, touch screen only
+ __Use a special ref version of msod__

# Other
+ __Get onto SF website__
+ check: my model says Superb Parrots are more likely with Noisy Miners!?

## Love to do
+ trait indications
+ show birds of particular body size
+ Easy way to get amount with 500m or 3000m of a latitude and longitude
  + a drop pin style interface would be great, but putting in lat lon would also be ok
+ context on managing Noisy Miners, and other farm-scale decisions?
+ convert to a mobile app - perahps using "shinyMobile" - but it might work well on a mobile naturally

+ __get permission from BirdLife:__ try James Oconnor
   + e.g. use of birdlife:
     + in more details report
     + in more details modal
     + in Noisy Miner check box

+ Example pictures of woody canopy

+ __photos of the birds will be really important. Maybe in the more details section. Tell a little story about the birds.__
   + use ALA, BirdLife or eBird
   + try Patrick Kavanagh and Craig Greer (might cost money)
   + send list to Tabitha

+ improved title?
  + 'Expected Spring Birds in Your Woodland'
  + 'Which Birds in Your Woodland'
  + 'Expected Birds: Woodland birds you can expect to see on your farm in spring'
  + 'Bird Anticipator: Woodland birds you can expect to see on your farm in spring'
  + 'Bird Checker'
