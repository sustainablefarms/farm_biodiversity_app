# Refactoring
+ functionality
  + FAQs
  + relative occupancy plot
  + leaflet takes a long time to load still, can I have a leaflet loading screen? Might have to be by hand: https://davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/tutorials/leaflet-loading-screens/

+ CHECK THAT STATS WORK FOR THE 5 VULNERABLE SPECIES

+ styling 1d
 + content slightly wider than screen,
 + make content much thinner for large desktop screens
 + the bird carousel is formatted poorly,
 + modals are formatted a bit poorly,
 + the buttons at bottom of the prediction tabs need neater description formatting, 
 + vulnerable species words poorly formatted, 
 + a few margin and color things, 
 + whatever Laura comes back with.
 + fonts - Sofia Pro is what  used by SF. It appears to be free for commercial used. I've downloaded it as a font-face kit (woff) from https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/sofia-pro. Examples of its use are in the downloaded zip, but it doesn't appear to work in that html.
    + include a fallback as per https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_websafe.asp
    + or include the font files directly: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_font-face_rule.asp

+ words
  + Check throughout consistency of headings â€“ whether they are sentence case, or first letter capitalised 
  + capilisation of Box Gum, Eucalypt etc


+ report 1d
+ polishing (days)
  + google analytics
  + waiters for the plots
  + waiter for leaflet regions (or at least letting rest of app get on with it)


# High Priority:
+ Cleaner use and description for references
+ types of farms in More Information. Could get from the 2010 Lindenmayer book? Talks about wheat sheep belt, and more
+ a notification when reference is updated, and when things change.
+ a warning that javascript is required
+ tooltips that work on phones: accordions
+ make 50m gap language clearer - see email with Ange
+ the species info about sensitivity into the species descriptions?
+ change 'must be provided' backup to something else for species estimate summaries
+ compute_richness use poccupancy_margotherspeciespmaxsite() -- see a branch
+ map like clicking: see https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers and https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/deployment/basemap-attribution/ for attribution instructions. I think it will work!!


Regular Priority:
+ make ggplot in more detail and reports same color scheme as summary online
+ set wvc for patch based on region
+ From Richard Beggs: references require some thought. Maybe a notification when you change things, and when you set the reference.
+ climate_modal() -> modal_climateplot()
+ onespecwords() -> onespec_occdesc()
+ patchincompletewarn() -> attrincomplete()
+ vulnerablespeciesUI() -> avulnerablespeciesUI()
+ wcf could be describes as 'proportion of vertical view that is blocked by foliage'
+ submit to shiny app contest

+ event tracking:
  + track more inputs 
    + change rainfall
    + number of patches

+ prettier reference to the tree cover page
+ when calling use_waiter specify the spinner(s) used

+ call plotly functions with plotly:: rather than a full imports
+ extra.html is imported for each predictions module
+ mostlikely plotly is over building itself

# Inputs
+ woody canopy in raw areas, not percentages

# Help
+ birds on farms imagery for splash page
+ use icons or virtual tours
+ make the website icon be sustainable farm's (called a favicon, and not possible for shinyapps)
+ Are the planted patches BGGW or not??

## More Help
+ species list? describe species
  + species removed
+ links to box gum grassy woodlands
+ acknowledgements
  + field team
  + Suzannah
  + van Dijk lab
  + DBL
  + MLA and Sustainable farms

## Caveats
+ get max patch size for model (Ask Dan for patch areas, to look for maximum in our data)
+ __test on other woodlands__

# Outputs
+ show the ref values in a tooltip or something
+ remove 'patch' column from downloaded table


# Outputs: More Detail

# Overall
+ Authorship: Martin, Albert, Dan?
+ for phone have a visible scroll bar or something that shows users there is more down the page, or smaller pages
+ checkbox checked color make in keeping with color scheme
+ from the mastering shiny book it almost looks like reactiveVal and reactiveValues are only useful in rare situations, but I'm not sure what they are. There were no examples of reactiveVal and reactive() operating together, so I don't have good idea of what the reactive graph looks like.

# Other
+ __Get onto SF website__

--- 

## Love to do
+ trait indications
+ show birds of particular body size
+ Easy way to get amount with 500m or 3000m of a latitude and longitude
  + a drop pin style interface would be great, but putting in lat lon would also be ok
  + they need to put year in

+ multiple named references

+ Example pictures of woody canopy
